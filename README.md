# Hostel Management System
This program simulates a Hostel Management System. It allows you to book, cancel, and upgrade room reservations for a hostel with multiple floors and rooms. The program uses a linked list-based approach to manage room occupancy.

## Features

1. **Book a Room**: You can book rooms for 1, 2, or 3 persons based on availability.

2. **Display Status**: You can view the current status of rooms on all floors.

3. **Cancel Cot**: You can cancel a reservation for a specific person in a room.

4. **Upgrade Name**: You can update the name of a person in a room.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using your C++ compiler.

2. Run the compiled executable.

3. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the Hostel Management System.

## How It Works

The program uses a linked list-based structure to represent rooms and their occupancy. The `hostel` class contains methods to perform operations like booking, cancellation, and upgrading. The `create` method initializes the hostel with rooms and beds. The `display` method shows the current status of rooms and beds on different floors.

## Notes

- The code is structured to accommodate a maximum of 3 persons per room.
- Floors and rooms are represented numerically.
- The program loops through a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Feel free to modify, extend, or enhance the code as needed.
